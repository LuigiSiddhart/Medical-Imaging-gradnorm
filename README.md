# Medical-Imaging-gradnorm
This code applies deep learning in
HEp-2 image analysis, used for the detection of autoimmune
diseases through indirect immunofluorescence. The implemented
kind of learning is multi-task learning for single patch intensity
classification, single patch pattern classification and single patch
segmentation. The used net is U-Net, in an encoder decoder architecture
in which the encoder is characterized with a backbone
realized with SE-Net.
